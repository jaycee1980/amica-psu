A USB PD power supply for Amiga computers

## PLEASE NOTE !!
This project is not yet finished ! The hardware is complete, but the firmware for the STM8 microcontroller is not finished. I decided to upload the project anyway rather than the work going to waste.
Hopefully if I can get my brain in working order, I will finish it.

## Does it even work?
The DC-DC conversion stuff works... see [here](https://youtu.be/czb_NR_QA5E) and [here](https://youtu.be/kD3LM56WTJc) to see it working
The HUSB238A works as it is being used in that second video on a breakout board. I have controlled the HUSB238 successfully using an Arduino.
